# Stringless Bass Project

Lawrence Wilen, Alec Chai, Marley Macarewich

## Summary

This repository contains all of the code, files, and documentation that are necessary for reproducing the stringless basses created during the Summer 2022 Projects to Products CEID Fellowship. Each folder contains necessary files for that iteration.

## Contents

- Working Bass Code
  - Code is labelled using semantic versioning (x.y.z), eg. version 0.2.1. Each y value represents a different physical version of the bass, while an updated z value represents an updated version of the code. For example, both the code labelled v0.4.0 and v0.4.1 would be compatible with the physical bass number v0.4, but v0.4.1 is the more recent version of the code. 
- Deprecated
  - This code is old, outdated, or incompatible with physical designs. It is included here just for documentation, but is not intended to be used seriously for any of the basses.
- Physical Design Files
  - Solidworks, CorelDraw, and exported DXF files necessary for laser cutting the bass prototypes.
- Softpot Calibration Files
  - This folder contains the code and excel sheets necessary to linearize the calibration of the softpots on the basses.
- Pre-alpha
  - This folder contains code that is under construction and uploaded for the purposes of testing.
