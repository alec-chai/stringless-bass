# Version 1: Bassless

## Summary

Bassless is the copycat iteration of the original wooden basses that we were given in the summer.

Our copycat iteration, Bassless (v1), uses nearly identical code to the original bass that we were given. 



## Notable Hardware

- Teensy 3.2
- BNO-055



## Changes

None - essentially original copy of code



## Notes

This code is roughly the same as the original code, but contains different softpot calibration values and has pins A6 and A7 reversed in terms of which ones map to L1/L3 in the code.
