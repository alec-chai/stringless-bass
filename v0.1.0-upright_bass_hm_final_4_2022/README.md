# Version 0: Homemade/Work

## Summary

HM version is the original wooden version of the bass given to us at the beginning of the summer. The code in this folder is what was given to us originally.

Our copycat iteration, Bassless (v1), uses nearly identical code to the original bass that we were given. 



## Changes

None - original copy of code



## Notes

There were two versions given to us that may have slightly different code to operate correctly. This will be updated later with the changes if necessary.
